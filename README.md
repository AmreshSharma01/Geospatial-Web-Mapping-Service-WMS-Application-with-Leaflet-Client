# Geospatial Web Mapping Service (WMS) Application with Leaflet Client

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of ENGO 641 (Design and Implementation of Geospatial Information Systems) at the University of Calgary. The goal of this assignment was to build a full-stack geospatial application integrating Web Mapping Services (WMS), spatial databases, Python web services, and a Leaflet-based web client.

The system demonstrates:
- Deployment of WMS using MapServer.
- Publication of spatial datasets (schools, roads, wards, and more).
- Web client development using Leaflet.js to visualize and interact with geospatial layers.
- Server-side query processing using Python CGI scripts.
- Integration of CanVec datasets via GeoPackage files.

## Technologies Used

- **MapServer** for WMS service deployment
- **Leaflet.js** for thin client web mapping
- **Python (CGI scripting)** for dynamic SQL queries
- **PostgreSQL/PostGIS** for geospatial data storage
- **ArcGIS Pro** and **QGIS** for data processing and visualization
- **GeoPackage (GPKG)** for data packaging
- **HTML/CSS** for web interface
